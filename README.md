# SdEconomy [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A dynamic economy plug-in built for Minecraft servers. This plugin is intended to be compatible 
with [SpongeVanilla](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla), [SpongeForge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/).

## Building
**Note:** If you do not have Gradle installed then use ./gradlew for Unix systems or Git Bash and gradlew.bat for Windows 
systems in place of any 'gradle' command.

In order to build SdEconomy run either `gradle spigotBuild` or `gradle spongeBuild` command. Once it is finished you will find
plug-in .jars exported into the `./build/libs` folder.
